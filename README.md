# ftc-team19767-2021-22-season
Code created for First Tech Challenge robotics competition robot during the 2021/22 season.

Allowed our team's robot to play "Freight Frenzy", the challenge game for the 21/22 season of FTC. This was done through a remote control, and its inputs were processed by the control code above. This allowed for control of the robot's driving, turning and "strafing" (moving side-to-side). In addition, the operator was able to control an intake mechanism for game pieces, as well as a conveyor belt.
